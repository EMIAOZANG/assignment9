Question 5For income per person level, Asia and South America has grown steadily in recent years. Europe saw a sudden decrease in its income per person in 2010 probabily due to the Eurozone Crisis. From the histograms, Africa and Asia have the majority of countries in low income per person levels (i.e. below $2000), and it remains that way with a few countries rising to high income levels in 2010.
The overall income per person distribution remained almost the same in each region throughout recent years.
