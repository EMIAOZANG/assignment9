From the plots we can see that, for the past five years, Oceania 
and South America are similar with median income, as well as Europe
and North America are similar with relatively high income. Africa
has the lowest income average and Asia has the most large differece
between max and min income. The changes within these years are not
significant among Africa, Asia, South America, and Oceania, but
noticeable for Europe and North America. The overall incomes increase
during 2008 to 2010 for both two regions. However they drop in 2011
and tend severely in 2012.
