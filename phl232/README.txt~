Question 5: Over the past 10 year, median GPD / Capita has remained relatively stable for Asia, Europe, and Africa. North America and Oceania have show slight growth, while median GDP/Capita has increased significantly. It's interesting to see that South America has the most evenly distributed growth among all regions i.e. even the lower percentiles have seen significant growth.
