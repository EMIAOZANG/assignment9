#This file contains a description of the trends in global income distribution

Looking at the plot describing the overall income distribution across the regions, we can see that
the richer regions had widened the gap relative to the poorer regions since 2000. Then, once the global
financial crisis hit, almost all the regions saw a downward movement in the median-country income, excluding Oceania.

In South America, the gap has widened with most of the income growth since 2000 occuring in the top half of the distribution.
In Oceania, basically all of the income gains since 2000 have occured in the richest country, which is Australia.
The distribution of wealth has stayed fairly constant in North America, and one can see that income growth overall has been stagnant.
Asia's poorer countries have not increased their wealth at all since 2000, all of the income gain accrued to the richest country, which
was hit hard by the global financial crisis which started in 2008.
The distribution of income has stayed fairly constant in Europe since 2000, and we can see that overall since 2000 wealth growth has been very weak.
Again, this can be attributed the the global financial crisis, along with the European Banking Crisis which followed in 2009.
The small amount of of growth in GDP per capita in Africa has been flowing towards that region's richest country. The bottom half of countries in 
Africa, in terms of income per person, have not increased thier wealth at all since the year 2000.
