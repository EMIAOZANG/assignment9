For question 5 in this assignment, I explored the distribution of the income per person by region from 2000 to 2012 through every 2 years. The result in boxplot was saved as 'Income by region from 2000 to 2012_boxplot.pdf' and the result in histogram was saved as 'Income by region from 2000 to 2012_hist.pdf'.

From boxplot, I got:
1) Asia and South America was in a steady income growth from 2000 to 2012;
2) Europe suffered an abrupt decrease from 2010. The median income per person in Europe in 2008 was near to $30,000 but it went down to approximately $20,000 in 2012. The reason may be the eurozone crisis in 2009.

From histograms, I got:
1) The overall income distribution did not change largely in each region.
2) Asia and Africa shows similar distribution: majority of countries stay in a low range area and few outlier countries possess high incomes. From 2000 to 2012, some countries got rid of low income. Thus, they shrank the income inequality in past 10 years but the inequality problem is still a challenge in this two regions.
3) Europe and North America shows similar distribution: majority of countries stay in the median range area. And in past 10 years, their income distribution becomes closer to a normal distribution.
