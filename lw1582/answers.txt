Over the past 10 years, the high end of income measured on a PPP base has increased in Asia and Africa. The highest income in Asia has increased from ~60K to ~90K. Highest real income in Africa rose from 14K in 2002 to 17K in 2012. This means that although real income has stayed the same in many countries, some countries in these regions have been experiencing rapid growth in real income. In South America, we see a trend of countries moving away from the low end. In South America, the majority of income distribution shifted from 3000 - 6000 in 2002 to 8000 - 14000 in 2012.
